### About my work there
At Panda Video, I contributed to the frontend of the product dashboard using Vue 2 and 3, with UI Components (Vuetify) as the foundation, developing complex and high-performance components, and implementing translations for English and Spanish.

I also helped to fix bugs and develop new features in the Player, which impact millions of users monthly.

On the backend, I've developed serverless APIs in Node.js for AWS (Lambda), integrations with third-party software such as Stripe, Pipedrive, Crisp, Mailchimp and ActiveCampaign. Also I built the integration plugin for WordPress, which currently has over 5,000 active installations.
